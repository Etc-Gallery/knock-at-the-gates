<p>On November 2, 1984, <a href="http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/US/barfield029.htm">Velma Barfield became the first woman to be executed after the end of the moratorium, and the first woman to be executed by lethal injection in United States history</a>. Barfield was convicted of the first-degree murder of Stuart Taylor, her then-fianceé, in December of 1978. There was no question of Barfield’s guilt; <a href="http://exhibits.lib.unc.edu/exhibits/show/capital-punishment/biographies/barfield">she confessed to the murder</a> after her sister called North Carolina police and tearfully told them that Barfield had poisoned Taylor and others. Though she was only tried for Taylor’s murder, she also confessed to poisoning her mother, Lillian Burke, and two others.</p>
<p>Following her conviction, Barfield became a born-again Christian. She garnered support from the Christian community, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1984/12/08/us/around-the-nation-graham-praises-woman-executed-for-murder.html">including evangelist Billy Graham</a>, as well as abolitionists across the nation. While incarcerated, she ministered to fellow inmates, and <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=AGA_FEsKRioC&amp;pg=PA389&amp;lpg=PA389&amp;dq=velma+barfield+hunt+politics&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=mSJamNfRGs&amp;sig=7f_FGsBRKt0lZGW3K8lbJDGmEi0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TiViVM-3N4qkyASY_IHQDw&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=velma%20barfield%20hunt%20politics&amp;f=false">prison officials called her a model prisoner and “a deeply religious person</a>.” <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/03/us/first-woman-is-executed-in-us-since-1962.html">Her supporters cited her religion</a> and the help she provided to fellow inmates as proof that she had changed. <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19840909&amp;id=WxgiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AaYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5054,6313287">They also emphasized her drug addiction</a> and the abuse she suffered at the hands of her father and husband, both of which could be considered mitigating factors, but neither of which was brought up at her original trial. Though these factors were addressed in her appeals, it was to no avail.</p>
<p>Failing before the court, Barfield asked North Carolina Governor James B. Hunt Jr. for clemency. He denied her request. This decision came at the end of a closely fought Senate race with Jesse Helms, the Republican incumbent. <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&amp;dat=19840909&amp;id=WxgiAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=AaYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5054,6313287">78 percent of North Carolina voters at the time supported capital punishment</a>, and <a href="http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1984/10/29/page/20/article/who-is-fit-for-justice">opponents argued that Hunt denied clemency as a political move</a>. He lost the race.</p>
<p>Politics wasn’t the only issue; at the time of her death, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/03/us/first-woman-is-executed-in-us-since-1962.html">it had been over twenty years since a woman had been executed in the United States</a>. <a href="http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1984/10/29/page/20/article/sex-politics-and-an-execution">Her supporters photographed her with her grandchildren</a>, and <a href="http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20089011,00.html"><em>People</em> Magazine called her</a> “a plump, hazel-eyed grandmother who reads her Bible daily, crochets dolls for her grandchildren and speaks in a soft, meek drawl.” The public and the media couldn’t reconcile her appearance as a gentle, spiritual caretaker with the fact of her crimes. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=Glt_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA246&amp;lpg=PA246&amp;dq=%22cold+killer+or+loving+grandma%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=snuVrPIJgY&amp;sig=YuH4eNFQSwsDrRDpmMtGMhlZhpo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yFpiVMq6EISkyQTP2YL4Cg&amp;ved=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cold%20killer%20or%20loving%20grandma%22&amp;f=false">As one <em>LA Times</em> article asked</a>: “Cold Killer or Loving Grandma?”</p>
<p>The gender gap is the greatest disparity on death row. Including Barfield, <a href="http://www.clarkprosecutor.org/html/death/usexecute.htm">fifteen women have been executed in the United States since 1977</a>—a mere 1 percent of the 1,390 executions. <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/DRUSAFall2014.pdf">According to the NAACP Legal Defense Fund</a>, as of October 1, 2014 there were 57 women on death row, constituting 1.88 percent of the total death row population. <a href="http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/documents/FemDeathDec2012.pdf">A 2012 report by Professor Victor Streib shows</a> that women account for 10 percent of annual murder arrests but only 2.1 percent of death sentences, and the numbers keep dropping as the trial continues. Women are less likely to be sentenced to death and, once sentenced, they are less likely to be executed.</p>
<p>Despite the low execution rate for female offenders, murders with female victims are much more likely to result in a death sentence. <a href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2402355">According to a Cornell Law School study</a>, 32.3 percent of murders involving male victims resulted in a death sentence, while 47.1 percent of murders with female victims did. The study used data from Delaware between 1976 and 2007 to attempt to explain “the female victim effect.” The study concludes that though murders with male and female victims have comparable numbers of aggravating or mitigating factors., the differences in heinousness, method of murder, perceived vulnerability, family responsibilities, and perceived disreputable behavior combine to “make cases with female victims seem and “feel” different than cases involving male victims.”</p>
<p>Barfield’s supporters were with her until the end. On the night of her death, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1984/11/03/us/first-woman-is-executed-in-us-since-1962.html">300 demonstrators stood a silent vigil</a> outside of the prison, clustered around a sign that spelled out the word “hope.” Each carried a candle that was extinguished as the execution took place.</p>
